Assignment 2: Marauder's Map

As specified by the lab, the HTML page uses navigator.geolocation to determine my current location and properly sends it (with my login) to the datastore API provided to request data of the characters and students. Using the Google Maps API, it renders a map with all specified requirements:
	- a unique marker specifying where I am with an info window that displays my latitude and longitude
	- unique markers for each character with an info window displaying their names, latitudes/longitudes, and note.
	- markers for the last 100 students in the datastore (including duplicates) with an info window displaying their name, location (latitude/longitude) and timestamp.
	- polylines between my marker and each of the characters.
	- distances between me and each character displayed in a box overlaying the map on the right hand side in a sorted fashion.

I worked on this assignment for approximately 10 hours alone, referencing many online resources to figure out how to piece everything together.
