<h5>Lab 7: Your News Feed</h5>

The index.html page, as specified by the lab, allows a user to enter messages in an input box and dynamically displays whatever
is typed in (and the enter key has been pressed) with a timestamp, preceded by a space, a hyphen, and another space. Messages are displayed with the latest messages on the top. The messages are also stored in local storage so that when the user leaves the page and reopens it, any old news is redisplayed.

HTML, Javascript, and JQuery were used to implement these features. I spent approximately 2 hours working on the assignment alone, referencing material/links provided on the lab specifications in addition to other online resources.
