Things Accomplished/Being Worked On This Week:
- Some links have been compiled (through YouTube) for the meditation pages of our project.
- The MongoDB/NodeJS databases have also been set-up with the needed fields to keep track of users (as specified in the last status report)

Things to do moving forward:
- Connecting everyone to the backend database on Heroku
- Same challenges as last week:
	- Password encryption, maybe?
	- Check to make sure someone has watched the entire video to give points correctly
- Get all the pages up and working!

1. Looking at your week 2 status report and this week's report, you've definitely made progress especially with the database stuff.
2. Still looking into using local storage to calculate time a user was at a gym?
3. Don't focus too much on password encryption and security.  Your goal is to have a functional _prototype_!
