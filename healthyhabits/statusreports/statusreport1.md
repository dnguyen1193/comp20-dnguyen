Status Report 1

Things in Progress for the Project/Accomplished:
- The different pages we would have for our website was planned out and split
	up into separate sections. Each member chose a different section to be
	responsible for, though we plan to collaborate and help each other on each
	of the sections.
- The skeletons for three of the pages have been created: the main
	page, the meditation page, and the profile page.
- A bootstrame framework was started with a skeleton file (though not yet
	in our respository) to give everyone access.
- The profile page draws a square canvas with dividers for the user and 
	challenger's profile picture, score, and score bar. Prototype images are 
	placed roughly where the profile pictures should be.

Challenges:
- It was difficult to come up with concrete ideas, but even more difficult
	to translate these concrete ideas into coded pages, since it requires
	looking up much more additional information.
- It was difficult to design the profile page from scratch (will probably 
	use Bootstrap & adapt some code from the templates).

Goals for Next Week:
- Get the Bootstrap framework working and pushed to the team repository.
- Get the filter for the meditation page working.
- Continue working on the skeletons for each of the pages.
- Figure out how to store & retrieve data from a database (probably via MySQL).

###Comments by Ming:
* "It was difficult to design the profile page from scratch" --don't.  Don't reinvent the wheel; use some template that has already been done for profile page.
* Why MySQL?  There's nothing wrong with the selection but I'm curious for the choice rationale.
