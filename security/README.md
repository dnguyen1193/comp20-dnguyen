Assignment 4: Security Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side

As specified by the lab, a security assessment has been performed on my partner's work for Assignment 3: Where in the World (Jeremy Goldman). Assignment 2 was not really tested, as many security issues itself were found in assignment 3 alone. An index page was created containing the security assessment document in HTML5 format with the sections: introduction, methodology, abstract of findings, issues found, and conclusion.

Security holes to look for were discussed in class last Tuesday (11/28) and used for this assignment. Additional online resources were used to determine ways to resolve the security issues. Nga Pham and I discussed what sorts of vulnerabilities each of the issues could cause.

Approximately 6 hours were spent completing this assignment.
