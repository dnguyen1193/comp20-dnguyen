README for Lab 5: "The six o'clock alarm would never ring"

As specified in the lab, the script element of the index.html page has been edited to annotate the music video.
Annotations appear line by line. Two photos are also used as part of the annotation.
style.css has been created as a stylesheet for the page.

I worked on this lab for approximately 7 hours alone using the pages linked on the lab as well as additional online resources.
